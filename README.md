# Chat-Client
A tiny instant messenger written in Java.  This was a project for one of my Java classes - it uses sockets and a bit of multithreading to 
construct a single anonymous chatroom, including name changing and private messaging.  I've only tested this on one machine (all clients and server on localhost), so 
I'm not sure what all would be necessary to make it work on the Internet.
